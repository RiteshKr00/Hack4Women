# Women Essentials

## 💡 Inspiration

• According to Lynn Enright a journalist- “It turns out that children and teenagers all over the world, including in the UK, are let down by educators who are too squeamish, too nervous, and too unsupported to properly deliver a robust sex education.”

• India lacks a curriculum for sex education.

• Sex education for women is trivial as it can help reduce child marriage and unplanned pregnancies by equipping young women with skills to navigate their sexualities and take control over their lives.

• We believe that our web app will be a way to educate our women of all ages, to explore themselves, to be more confident, and safe.

• We also focus on prenatal education for a healthy pregnancy.
