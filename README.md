# Women Essentials

## 💡 Inspiration

• According to Lynn Enright a journalist- “It turns out that children and teenagers all over the world, including in the UK, are let down by educators who are too squeamish, too nervous, and too unsupported to properly deliver a robust sex education.”

•	Sex education is considered as a taboo in many countries, it is very difficult for young girls to understand what they are going through, and guardians always avoid these converstions. 

• India lacks a curriculum for sex education.

• Sex education for women is trivial as it can help reduce child marriage and unplanned pregnancies by equipping young women with skills to navigate their sexualities and take control over their lives.

• We believe that our web app will be a way to educate our women of all ages, to explore themselves, to be more confident, and safe.

• We also focus on prenatal education for a healthy pregnancy.


## 💻 What it does

•	It is a safe place for exploring women's sex education.

•	It also provides counseling for pregnant women regarding common health issues, healthy practices, and connects with the top doctors across the world.

•	A chatroom to connect with women facing the same issues, and get experienced solutions for the same.
